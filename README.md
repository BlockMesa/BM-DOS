# BM-DOS - Really bad MS-DOS 3.30 recreation designed for terminals
### To idiot-proof the terminal and prevent the OS from being overwritten, run `secureboot on`
To disable it, run `secureboot off`

Disabling it requires a pin be set (its stored in plain text, dont be an idiot)

Before you say anything is inaccurate, please check if it was like that in MS-DOS 3.30
